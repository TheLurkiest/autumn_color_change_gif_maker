Things I'm currently working on seeing if I can make work properly within THIS repo, to use elsewhere, and in other related repos:

Attempt to put animated color-altered pokemon onto the field-- using animated gifs as our source material

Normal= beige 

3> Fire= light red

Fighting= VERY light brown 

11> Water= medium/dark-blue

Flying= VERY light purple (almost white-- very watered-down lavender-- and also on the other end of the spectrum, a sort of orangish-maroon color as well) 

4> Grass= green

5> Poison= purple 

1> Electric= bright yellow

> Ground= light brown 

2> Psychic= orangish-gold and dark-pink

A. hybridizing by type

# easiest/quickest/funnest way to diversify, and give new experiences:

    create system of hybridized typing-- you don.t need to spend a bunch of time on this-- just have every encounter have some percentage chance of having hybrid show up-- wherein either:
        1) if pokemon is mono-type, this simply ADDS a secondary type-- but uses the EXISTING type as a baseline for what sorts of changes should take place:
            > for example, if mono-type grass, then API hybridizer specifically looks for GREEN in your .gif animation and replaces it with PURPLE, if you.re adding the POISON secondary type.

To start with, let.s just experiment with seeing if we can alter some of the more interesting types.  As you can see, I numbered the most interesting/best/most do-able types 1-11 above.  Every other type is too vague, ambiguous, and difficult to work with-- so we should only allow those 7 types to hybridize, since they.re a little bit more conventional in terms of creating a bit of code that can alter these images in a way that might look neat.

B. the fly in the ointment

# we still don.t know why our background in our gif.s, freaks out and flashes colors-- we might want to figure out how to make it cleaner/clearer again before proceeding with what we have


C. flipping the images

# this one might be more straight-forward-- we would just need to flip our gif.s to allow them to look like they have directional movement.


D. psychadelic flashing attacks/damage

# this comes later-- but want to see if animated gifs can be easily made to flash some color when damage is taken or attack move is initiated of a given type


E. just finish up setting up our little API-- reincorporating some of the templates back into what we.ve been working on-- and then see if we can get some basic sort of functionality such that we could ACTUALLY GET OUR LITTLE ANIMATED AVATARS TO MOVE-- think, cockroach madness basically.

...and that.s it for this thing, for now!  That.s all I really want to do with this-- over the long-term I have many thoughts on why I find all this interesting, but this is all I would really want to do for the time being.
